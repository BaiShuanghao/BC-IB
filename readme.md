For LIBERO experiments, our code is primarily built upon the [LIBERO source code](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO). The baseline implementations are mainly adapted from the LIBERO source code, while the environment is set up using [robosuite](https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite).

For CortexBench experiments, our code is primarily based on the [eai-vc source code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/eai-vc). The baselines reference [ResNet](https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks), [ViT](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer), [R3M](https://github.com/facebookresearch/r3m), [MVP](https://github.com/ir413/mvp), [VC-1](https://github.com/facebookresearch/eai-vc), [Voltron](https://github.com/siddk/voltron-robotics), and [MPI](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/MPI), while the environment setup is based on [CortexBench](https://github.com/facebookresearch/eai-vc), [dmc2gym](https://github.com/denisyarats/dmc2gym), [MetaWorld](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Metaworld), [trifinger_simulation](https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/trifinger_simulation), [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym), and [MuJoCo](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco).
